# MineStorm 3DS

![Project Icon](icon.png?raw=true "MineStorm 3DS")

This project is a c++ remake of one of my old projects; MineStorm which was based itself on the game MineStorm (1982) for the Vertrex

The goal was to remake the project in c++ (the first one was in C) for the Nintendo 3DS.
The project requires [libctru](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru) in order to compile

## Building

If not done already, install devkitPro and libctru.

Then, from the devkitPro terminal run "make"
You can run "make clean" to remove all build files

The build will be located at the root folder
